From the data you can calculate the average `Cust_Last_Purchase` for those who are in the train set and had the last purchase (`Cust_Last_Purchase`>0) .

    "Sometimes we can use high level features that reflect the interactions between the columns as new features to get better insight and feed more information to our predictive models. Also transformation of some columns can be better options to be fed to the models. For instance, instead of a numerical column, you can use log of the column, square of the column, or any other transformation of the column. The type of interaction, or transformation you should choose, can be defined after Exploratory data analysis or just business insight.\n",
